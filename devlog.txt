- Created dummy database and implemented test templates to be rendered by home page.

Selena -- 2025-2-23 5:40 PM
- Added spotify app to set up backend for calls to spotify api - keeping it separate from other code to be neater
- still need to connect to frontend but the paths for us to make our request to spotify api, authenticate user, and check if user is authenticated is set up
- model updated so that we can store user tokens 
- utils.py storing the functions that are directly interacting with the database
- credentials.py is storing secret key and id and stuff
- also updated mysite's urls.py to include the new urls that i've added to spotify urls.py
- code has not been thoroughly tested because i've not connected to frontend and actually tested requesting+receiving data yet

- app is able to connect to someone's spotify account (tested on my account)
- need to test out getting the data we need from spotify still though
- also removing secret keys from github repo (accidentally added oops - will be changing the keys)

- all three spotify paths officially work!!!! - able to connect to spotify and user is able to authorize us to access their data YAY
- now need to get the data from spotify so that we can make music recs

- added react frontend and connected with backend using a tutorial, so will have to edit code.
- need to work on js files to reflect proper routing. 

Jacky -- 2025-3-11 12:23 AM
- created components folder in frontend where website frontend will be designed (still in progress)

- /spotify/top-artists now displays user's top artists!! (10 specifically and these artists are the top from past 6 months)
- urls got changed after adding react so after getting account authorized, user is getting redirected to spotify/top-artists which I'll change once base url is back up and running again
- also getting Can't resolve 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css' error in frontend side but doesn't seem to be affecting anything for now so it's a later problem, just noting it here to remember it
- might also just be an issue on my end
- still need to clean up data because right now there's a lot of unnecessary things we won't need to use (image urls for example) so no need to send that over to frontend
