Gordon -- 2025-2-20 10:30 PM
- Created dummy database and implemented test templates to be rendered by home page.

Selena -- 2025-2-23 5:40 PM
- Added spotify app to set up backend for calls to spotify api - keeping it separate from other code to be neater
- still need to connect to frontend but the paths for us to make our request to spotify api, authenticate user, and check if user is authenticated is set up
- model updated so that we can store user tokens 
- utils.py storing the functions that are directly interacting with the database
- credentials.py is storing secret key and id and stuff
- also updated mysite's urls.py to include the new urls that i've added to spotify urls.py
- code has not been thoroughly tested because i've not connected to frontend and actually tested requesting+receiving data yet

Selena -- 2025-2-23 6:28 PM
- app is able to connect to someone's spotify account (tested on my account)
- need to test out getting the data we need from spotify still though
- also removing secret keys from github repo (accidentally added oops - will be changing the keys)

Selena -- 2025-2-23 6:59 PM
- all three spotify paths officially work!!!! - able to connect to spotify and user is able to authorize us to access their data YAY
- now need to get the data from spotify so that we can make music recs

Gordon -- 2025-2-26 05:30 PM
- added react frontend and connected with backend using a tutorial, so will have to edit code.
- need to work on js files to reflect proper routing. 

Jacky -- 2025-3-11 12:23 AM
- created components folder in frontend where website frontend will be designed (still in progress)

Selena -- 2025-3-12 11:56 PM
- /spotify/top-artists now displays user's top artists!! (10 specifically and these artists are the top from past 6 months)
- urls got changed after adding react so after getting account authorized, user is getting redirected to spotify/top-artists which I'll change once base url is back up and running again
- also getting Can't resolve 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css' error in frontend side but doesn't seem to be affecting anything for now so it's a later problem, just noting it here to remember it
- might also just be an issue on my end
- still need to clean up data because right now there's a lot of unnecessary things we won't need to use (image urls for example) so no need to send that over to frontend

Selena -- 2025-3-13 2:14 PM
- cleaned up /spotify/top-artists to only give name of artist and how many followers they have
- also added /spotify/top-tracks endpoint to give user's top songs (cleaned up data to give name of song and name(s) of artist(s))

Selena -- 2025-3-13 3:56 PM
- /spotify/recently-played now displays user's recently listened to songs (song name + name(s) of artist(s))

Gordon -- 2025-3-16 10:03 PM
- started on landing page designing
- delete unnecessary files in frontend

Selena -- 2025-3-20 9:17 PM
- updated the post authenticating path after user presses green connect to spotify button
- now goes to auth url -> callback function -> frontend base url (backend) -> this base url makes call to index function -> index function returns redirect to http://127.0.0.1:3000/top-artists 
- also updated Artists.js (specifically useState and what's getting returned) to print out user's top artists' names and num of followers
- now we can see user's top artists in the frontend page!!!!!!

Selena -- 2025-3-20 9:30 PM
- ok so what i did above was unnecessary (in terms of all the post auth url stuff in the first and second bullet points)
- basically redirecting to http://localhost:3000/top-artists DOES NOT WORK and caused the issue
- redirecting to http://127.0.0.1:3000/top-artists WORKS and i can redirect to this directly from the return of the callback function with successful calls to backend endpoint to get top artists
- don't know why though will need to figure it out later
- will push first with the probably useless files in case they turn out to be not so useless

Selena -- 2025-4-11 4:26 PM
- changed top-artists frontend route to spotify-data
- it now displays the user's top artists, top tracks, and recent listens

Selena -- 2025-4-16 4:10 PM
- able to connect to open ai api and feed it test data to get song recommendations (testing in tests.py)
- however, the song recommendations being sent back aren't always real songs and/or real artists

Jacky -- 2025-4-17 12:33 AM
- added last.fm folder to recommend similar artists using last.fm api
- still working on integrating the last.fm api to backend and frontend

Jacky -- 2025-4-17 7:50 PM
- last.fm api is now able to show similar artists but there is an issue for some artists that have a name in another language
- also added spotify api endpoints for retrieving an artist and their top tracks

Selena -- 2025-4-17
- changed spotify top tracks and recently played endpoint to return the artists in an array instead of string
- created Similar.js page to display the artists that are similar to the artists the user listens to
- however getting Could not proxy request error because fetch(lastfm/similar-artists?q=[artistname]) isn't going to the backend route

Selena -- 2025-4-18 11:40 AM
- proxy request was because one of my artists has an & in their name - fixed by calling encodeURIComponent() on the artist name before adding it to url
- also removed artists that the user already listens to from the list of similar artists

Selena -- 2025-4-18 7:05 PM
- fixed spotify/artist endpoint
- started to work on compiling top tracks of each of the similar artists to pass over to open ai api
- got the ids of the artists but now need to make api calls to get the top tracks of each of those artists

Jacky -- 2025-4-18 8:27 PM
- fixed spotify/artist-top-tracks endpoint and added an artist query at the end of the url
- added header to the similar-artists page on frontend but need to remove the "Connect Account" button

Jacky -- 2025-4-18 8:46 PM
- removed the "Connect Account" button on similar-artists page

Selena -- 2025-4-18 9:53 PM
- still working on the same thing

Jacky -- 2025-4-18 11:30 PM
- added a carousel on the App.js page

Selena -- 2025-4-19 1:35 AM
- I can see the list of recommended songs being generated but it's a lot of songs with a lot of repeats probably because of the asynchronous handling of calls in js??
- but then the calls towards the end all end up getting errors below
- Errors: 
GET http://127.0.0.1:3000/spotify/artist-top-tracks?q=Lucy%20Dacus 500 (Internal Server Error)
getSongList @ Recommend.js:99
Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
and also:
Uncaught (in promise) SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'P', "Proxy erro"... is not valid JSON
- perhaps because requests to artist-top-tracks are being made at the same time as requests are being made to similar-artists endpoint??
- the error isn't specific to an artist because the artists who are getting the internal server error have successful made requests to that endpoint previously
- it's also different artists triggering these errors each time

Jacky -- 2025-4-19 1:44 PM
- added a dropdown menu after the user connects their Spotify account where they can access their spotify data, similar artists, and recommended songs.
- also made a Features and About Us page
- also made the Recommendify text on the top left of the header return the user back to the App.js page
- made carousel stay in each slide for 10 sec for readability

Selena -- 2025-4-20 1:15 AM
- cleaned up code, continuing to work on open ai stuff

Selena -- 2025-4-20 2:41 AM
- /recommendations now displays open ai recommendations
- need to make sure the songs are all real
- also need to speed up the process somehow - no one wants to wait an hour just to get song recommendations
- and the openai recommendations aren't formatted yet, it's just directly what openai generates - need to get the response formatted properly

Selena -- 2025-4-21 
- pip install markdown to display the openai result as html
- getting error artist_id = search_response["artists"]["items"][0]["id"]
KeyError: 'artists' from spotify's views.py
- changed it so that we only start getting similar artists once all the spotify data has been populated because I noticed that the similar artists are sometimes artists that user already listens to
- requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.spotify.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /v1/search?q=Meg%20Mac&type=artist (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7f5e28528400>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable'))
- also got the above error
- changed package.json proxy so that it points to 127.0.0.1:8000 instead of localhost:8000 because I was getting could not proxy request errors
- also raise MaxRetryError(_pool, url, reason) from reason  # type: ignore[arg-type]
urllib3.exceptions.MaxRetryError: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='ws.audioscrobbler.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2.0/?method=artist.getsimilar&artist=Riley+Whittaker&api_key=2b421c867985de9e7d12ddace94cd723&format=json&limit=1 (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7faca2ded060>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 101] Network is unreachable'))?????
