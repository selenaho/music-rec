- Created dummy database and implemented test templates to be rendered by home page.

Selena -- 2025-2-23 5:40 PM
- Added spotify app to set up backend for calls to spotify api - keeping it separate from other code to be neater
- still need to connect to frontend but the paths for us to make our request to spotify api, authenticate user, and check if user is authenticated is set up
- model updated so that we can store user tokens 
- utils.py storing the functions that are directly interacting with the database
- credentials.py is storing secret key and id and stuff
- also updated mysite's urls.py to include the new urls that i've added to spotify urls.py
- code has not been thoroughly tested because i've not connected to frontend and actually tested requesting+receiving data yet

- app is able to connect to someone's spotify account (tested on my account)
- need to test out getting the data we need from spotify still though
- also removing secret keys from github repo (accidentally added oops - will be changing the keys)

- all three spotify paths officially work!!!! - able to connect to spotify and user is able to authorize us to access their data YAY
- now need to get the data from spotify so that we can make music recs

Gordon -- 2025-2-26 05:30 PM
- added react frontend and connected with backend using a tutorial, so will have to edit code.
- need to work on js files to reflect proper routing. 

Jacky -- 2025-3-11 12:23 AM
- created components folder in frontend where website frontend will be designed (still in progress)

Selena -- 2025-3-12 11:56 PM
- /spotify/top-artists now displays user's top artists!! (10 specifically and these artists are the top from past 6 months)
- urls got changed after adding react so after getting account authorized, user is getting redirected to spotify/top-artists which I'll change once base url is back up and running again
- also getting Can't resolve 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css' error in frontend side but doesn't seem to be affecting anything for now so it's a later problem, just noting it here to remember it
- might also just be an issue on my end
- still need to clean up data because right now there's a lot of unnecessary things we won't need to use (image urls for example) so no need to send that over to frontend

Selena -- 2025-3-13 2:14 PM
- cleaned up /spotify/top-artists to only give name of artist and how many followers they have
- also added /spotify/top-tracks endpoint to give user's top songs (cleaned up data to give name of song and name(s) of artist(s))

Selena -- 2025-3-13 3:56 PM
- /spotify/recently-played now displays user's recently listened to songs (song name + name(s) of artist(s))

Gordon -- 2025-3-16 10:03 PM
- started on landing page designing
- delete unnecessary files in frontend

Selena -- 2025-3-20 9:17 PM
- updated the post authenticating path after user presses green connect to spotify button
- now goes to auth url -> callback function -> frontend base url (backend) -> this base url makes call to index function -> index function returns redirect to http://127.0.0.1:3000/top-artists 
- also updated Artists.js (specifically useState and what's getting returned) to print out user's top artists' names and num of followers
- now we can see user's top artists in the frontend page!!!!!!

Selena -- 2025-3-20 9:30 PM
- ok so what i did above was unnecessary (in terms of all the post auth url stuff in the first and second bullet points)
- basically redirecting to http://localhost:3000/top-artists DOES NOT WORK and caused the issue
- redirecting to http://127.0.0.1:3000/top-artists WORKS and i can redirect to this directly from the return of the callback function with successful calls to backend endpoint to get top artists
- don't know why though will need to figure it out later
- will push first with the probably useless files in case they turn out to be not so useless

Selena -- 2025-4-11 4:26 PM
- changed top-artists frontend route to spotify-data
- it now displays the user's top artists, top tracks, and recent listens

Selena -- 2025-4-16 4:10 PM
- able to connect to open ai api and feed it test data to get song recommendations (testing in tests.py)
- however, the song recommendations being sent back aren't always real songs and/or real artists
