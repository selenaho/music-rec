- Created dummy database and implemented test templates to be rendered by home page.

Selena -- 2023-2-23 5:40 PM
- Added spotify app to set up backend for calls to spotify api - keeping it separate from other code to be neater
- still need to connect to frontend but the paths for us to make our request to spotify api, authenticate user, and check if user is authenticated is set up
- model updated so that we can store user tokens 
- utils.py storing the functions that are directly interacting with the database
- credentials.py is storing secret key and id and stuff
- also updated mysite's urls.py to include the new urls that i've added to spotify urls.py
- code has not been thoroughly tested because i've not connected to frontend and actually tested requesting+receiving data yet
